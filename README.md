JMSimpleDate
============

`NSDate` and `NSDateFormatter` wrappers including simplification and convenience methods.

### History

I've always hated working with `NSDate` because it was such a pain to get very simple information from it (especially date comparison). I pulled some code from [Erica] (https://github.com/erica/) (thanks, Erica!) and got to work revising her methods and making them my own. If you have a chance, check out her repos. She has some good stuff.

### Instructions

Import `JMSimpleDate.h` and get to work! You'll automatically import the other `NSDate` and `NSDateFormatter` categories.

### ARC Support
